# Contributing to ENC

Thank you for considering contributing to the ENC project! We welcome all contributions, whether it’s a bug fix, new feature, or improvements to the documentation.

Branching Model

We follow a simple branching model:
	•	main branch: This is the stable branch containing production-ready code.
	•	dev branch: This is the main development branch where new features and fixes are integrated before being merged into main.
	•	Feature branches: For any new feature or bug fix, please create a new branch off of dev. Once your work is complete and reviewed, it will be merged back into dev and eventually into main.
